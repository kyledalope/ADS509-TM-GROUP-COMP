    "\n",
    "The task of comparing two groups of text is fundamental to textual analysis. There are innumerable applications: survey respondents from different segments of customers, speeches by different political parties, words used in Tweets by different constituencies, etc. In this assignment you will build code to effect comparisons between groups of text data, using the ideas learned in reading and lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment asks you to analyze the lyrics and Twitter descriptions for the two artists you selected in Module 1. If the results from that pull were not to your liking, you are welcome to use the zipped data from the “Assignment Materials” section. Specifically, you are asked to do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Read in the data, normalize the text, and tokenize it. When you tokenize your Twitter descriptions, keep hashtags and emojis in your token set. \n",
    "* Calculate descriptive statistics on the two sets of lyrics and compare the results. \n",
    "* For each of the four corpora, find the words that are unique to that corpus. \n",
    "* Build word clouds for all four corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of the analyses has a section dedicated to it below. Before beginning the analysis there is a section for you to read in the data and do your cleaning (tokenization and normalization). \n"

    "## Find tokens uniquely related to a corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we would use TF-IDF to find unique tokens in documents. Unfortunately, we either have too few documents (if we view each data source as a single document) or too many (if we view each description as a separate document). In the latter case, our problem will be that descriptions tend to be short, so our matrix would be too sparse to support analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, we will create a custom statistic to identify words that are uniquely related to each corpus. The idea is to find words that occur often in one corpus and infrequently in the other(s). Since corpora can be of different lengths, we will focus on the _concentration_ of tokens within a corpus. \"Concentration\" is simply the count of the token divided by the total corpus length. For instance, if a corpus had length 100,000 and a word appeared 1,000 times, then the concentration would be $\\frac{1000}{100000} = 0.01$. If the same token had a concentration of $0.005$ in another corpus, then the concentration ratio would be $\\frac{0.01}{0.005} = 2$. Very rare words can easily create infinite ratios, so you will also add a cutoff to your code so that a token must appear at least $n$ times for you to return it. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of these calculations can be found in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P87fkyslJhqXFnfYezNYrDrXp_GS8gwSATsZymv-9ms). Please don't hesitate to ask questions if this is confusing. \n",

    "1. The token appears at least `n` times in all corpora\n",
    "1. The tokens are in the top 10 for the highest ratio of appearances in a given corpora vs appearances in other corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose a cutoff for yourself based on the side of the corpus you're working with. If you're working with the Robyn-Cher corpora provided, `n=5` seems to perform reasonably well."
